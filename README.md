===================

### Instructions:
* Open the driver file (in the driver directory) in Processing
* In the toolbar at the top of your computer screen, select "Sketch" > "Import a library" > "Add a library"
* Search for, and install, the ControlP5 library
* Restart Processing if necessary

### A Guide for Colors:
*Yellow means the value you are currently at
*Red means a value that the sort is interested in
*Cyan means the two values have been switched
*Purple means the region is relatively sorted
*Blue means the sort has finished
*Green is normal element color

### Sliders!:
*Use the speed slider to control the speed of the sort
*Set the speed before selecting the sort
*It is a percentage. 100% is max speed. 0% is min speed.

### Notes:
* Initially we intended to include mergesort and quicksort as well, but soon discovered that Processing was more involved than we had predicted. These sorts' recursive structure, combined with the way Processing's draw() method works, made them especially hard to code
* Commits are misleading! When we worked together, we often worked on one computer, so although Github's graphs might not indicate this, we all did roughly equal work
